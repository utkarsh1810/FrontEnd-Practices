    <h1>Hello Fonts</h1>
    <p>By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face makes it possible to design content without being limited to the so-called "web-safe" fonts (that is, the fonts which are so common that they're considered to be universally available). The ability to specify the name of a locally-installed font to look for and use makes it possible to customize the font beyond the basics while making it possible to do so without relying on an Internet connection.
